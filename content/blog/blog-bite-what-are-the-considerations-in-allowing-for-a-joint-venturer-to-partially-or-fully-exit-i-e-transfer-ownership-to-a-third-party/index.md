[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/298684/Corporate+Governance/The+Joint+Operating+Agreement) discusses how time restrictions for sale, approval mechanism, allocation of risk among other things, are considerations for the entry and exit of new joint venture members. Withdrawal of a member (without transfer) may trigger additional concerns and consequences.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
