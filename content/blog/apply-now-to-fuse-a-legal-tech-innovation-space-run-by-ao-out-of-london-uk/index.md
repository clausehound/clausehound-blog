In the far off lands of London (yes, England), there are exciting things about to happen for innovation, and Clausehound is excited to share the details with you!

 

World-renowned law firm Allen & Overy (A&O) will be launching Fuse, a new tech innovation space, in September 2017. 

 

 

Fuse aims to be a space where legal tech companies, lawyers, clients, and A&O’s technologists and practitioners can collaborate on, explore, develop and test practical solutions to some of the most intractable challenges faced by companies, financial institutions and law firms today.

 

A&O is seeking mature startup tech companies to apply to work with them at Fuse. Applications are NOW OPEN for companies interested in collaborating alongside the people at Fuse and making their ideas a reality with input from leading financial institutions and companies. You can access the application form [here](https://www.f6s.com/fuse2017byallenovery/apply)!
