[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/525942/employee+rights+labour+relations/Arbitration+Clauses+In+Employment+Agreements+Are+They+Enforceable) explores the enforceability of mandatory arbitration clauses in employment agreements. Citing Morrison v. Ericsson Canada Inc, the author cautions employees against initiating legal proceedings on matters subject to arbitration as the action can be stayed.
