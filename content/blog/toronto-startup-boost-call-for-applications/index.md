### What is the Startup Boost Program?

**Startup Boost** is an intensive global pre-accelerator program with a mission to prepare pre-seed stage startups for accelerators and seed investment with hand-on mentorship and connections. Past programs have helped more than 130 startups get into top accelerators and raise more than $39M in funding after program completion.

 

### How does it work?

Each cohort takes place over a 6 week period in the evenings at the TWG head office and brings the best speakers and mentors to work with selected early stage tech startup teams to prepare them for accelerators, investment and revenue generation.

 

### What commitment is required?

We require a one night commitment over 6 weeks to take part in the program.

 

Uniquely with Startup Boost there is no equity taken from startup companies on this program.

 

Post program they have access to continued support from their chapter directors locally as well as the growing community of community leaders within the Startup Boost network to help them expand in new markets in Europe, Canada and the United States.
