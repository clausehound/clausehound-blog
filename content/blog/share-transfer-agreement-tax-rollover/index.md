**What is a tax rollover and how does a share transfer affect my taxes?**

A share transfer from a party - to a corporate entity under which shares are held by the same party, is called a "rollover".  These same principles apply to an asset transfer from a party to a corporation for which shares are held by the same party.

The purpose of a rollover transaction is to acknowledge that, although a sale or disposition of shares (or assets) has occurred at the time of transfer, there is no actual cash benefit that results from the disposition because the assets are held by the same party before and after (afterwards through the party's corporation). No one has paid anyone cash for these shares or assets.  So there is no immediate tax implication (in theory). Instead, the tax authorities will record the value of the transfer and will apply their tax calculation later on down the road when there is an actual cash-based transaction.  There may be a benefit to transferring these shares in this way at present, for example, the trigger may capture value in a capital gains tax exemption that can be recorded in present day, and assist the shareholder (asset holder) on the future day when cash is received for the shares/assets at the time of a future sale.  Make sure to consult with tax counsel and/or accountants to confirm whether these concepts make sense in your jurisdiction.
