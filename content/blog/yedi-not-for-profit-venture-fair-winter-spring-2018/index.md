Our partner organization YEDI is excited to announce their not-for-profit venture fair!

Come take a look at not-for-profit organizations that have been operating for more than 2 years as they join an intense incubation program headed by experts.

It's not just cool to find out about how all these organizations are helping; it's also a good networking opportunity!
