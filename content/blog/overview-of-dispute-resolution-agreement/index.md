**Overview of Dispute Resolution Agreement**What is this document?‘Dispute resolution’ refers to the process by which disputes are to be resolved between parties to an agreement. The two basic approaches to resolving disputes are the court system, and mediation/arbitration. Mediation and arbitration are often referred to as ‘alternative dispute resolution’ (ADR) because they offer an alternative to the courts, and most ‘dispute resolution’ clauses deal with mediation and arbitration. The dispute resolution process can be included as a clause in an agreement, or it can be drafted as a stand-alone agreement, or a schedule to an agreement. 

 

When would I use this document?

Since the potential for a dispute can arise in the context of any contract, dispute resolution clauses are found in a wide range of agreements. If the parties want to use mediation or arbitration a formal dispute resolution process should be included in the agreement. Where parties to an agreement are not located in the same jurisdiction (eg. different countries) international arbitration may be chosen rather than the courts of either party’s jurisdiction.

 

Who signs this document?A dispute resolution agreement is signed between the parties to the contract. Dispute resolution agreements can be used to resolve issues between members of the same organization, between different organizations, between individuals and the governments, and among many other parties.

Some parties choose to provide for an informal process of resolving disputes before involving a judge or an arbitrator.
