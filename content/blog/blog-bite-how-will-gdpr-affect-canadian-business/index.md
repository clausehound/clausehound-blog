[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/619402/data+protection/What+GDPR+Means+For+Canadian+Businesses) discusses how the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is soon to take effect, meaning Canadian businesses who handle the personal information of EU residents will need to review their privacy policies.
