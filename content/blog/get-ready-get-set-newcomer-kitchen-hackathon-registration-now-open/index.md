On October 28th, our partner organization **StartGBC** are hosting the Newcomer Kitchen Hackathon and have just opened registrations.

**Newcomer Kitchen** is a nonprofit organization that invites newly-arrived Syrian refugee women to cook a weekly meal in its kitchen. The meals are sold online for pickup or delivery, and the proceeds shared among the cooks. At this event participants in the hackathon will be trying to create a model to welcome newcomers to a community that can be replicated with any group, in any restaurant kitchen, in any city in the world.
