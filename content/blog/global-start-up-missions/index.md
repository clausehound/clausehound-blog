Our partner organization York Entrepreneurship Development Institution is opening applications for their Israel Start-Up Mission!

Using their connections with like-minded partners around the world, YEDI's start-up missions help entrepreneurs to succeed abroad by connecting them with local partners and resources.

If you know anybody looking to expand or begin their business in Israel, encourage them to apply by January 10th! Winners will participate in a 2-week free program.
