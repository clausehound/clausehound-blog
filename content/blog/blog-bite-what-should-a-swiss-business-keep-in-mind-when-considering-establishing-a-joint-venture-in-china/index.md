[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/466782/M+A+Private+equity/Switzerland+Growing+Asian) looks at the growing relationship of Switzerland to Asia by means of a free trade agreement that creates prospects for growth through mergers and acquisitions in a variety of industries, or even joint ventures„though a caveat here for the Swiss is that a joint venture agreement is not legally binding for some parts of shareholders' meetings and the board of directors.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
