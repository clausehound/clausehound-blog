[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/133708/Social+Media/Potential+Legal+Issues+Associated+With+Internet+Promotions) documents various potential legal issues that can be associated with Internet promotions (e.g., intellectual property and copyright infringement claims, defamation or libel, publicity rights, and public voting rights). The author notes that, in addition to ensuring compliance with applicable state and federal laws, promotion sponsors must also comply with a website's Terms and Conditions. For instance, a business hosting an online promotion through YouTube must also comply with YouTube's promotion guidelines, which provide (among others) an indemnification provision in its favor for any claims relating to the promotion.
