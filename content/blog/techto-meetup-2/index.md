Our partner organization **TechToronto** is having their next meeting on December 4th.  Many CEOs and founders have spoken at these monthly events, with another 5 speaking at the next meeting at RBC WaterPark Place.

This is a great way for entrepreneurs to expand their connections and to network with other like-minded people, and just to check out some cool new tech!
