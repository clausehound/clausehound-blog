**Clausehound will be attending the StartUp HERE Toronto Cafe Launch on Monday June 27 in Toronto. Come say hi to us, we're giving away 10 three-month memberships to our [Small Business Law Library ](https://clausehound.com/small-business-law-library/) at the event!  **

Mayor John Tory launched a new mentoring platform for entrepreneurs and small businesses with program partner Ten Thousand Coffees.

"This initiative will help make Toronto's business community more accessible to those developing their businesses and careers," said Mayor Tory. "We are pleased to help open the doors to success for future generations of entrepreneurs."

The StartUp HERE Toronto Café, being hosted at [www.startupheretoronto.com/coffeechat](http://www.startupheretoronto.com/coffeechat), builds upon the network already established by acclaimed Toronto startup Ten Thousand Coffees, which currently has more than 60,000 users in the greater Toronto area (GTA).

“Coffee chats are the best way for young professionals, industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and students to get started – whether you have an idea, are interested in innovation, or looking to hire, go to TenThousandCoffees.com and meet with others," said Dave Wilkin, founder of TenThousandCoffees.com. "Getting coffee with someone interesting is now just a few clicks away, it’s free and available to anyone interested in entrepreneurship and innovation in the City of Toronto.”

By encouraging people to network in person and virtually, the StartUp HERE Toronto Café will expand the networks of mentors available to entrepreneurs when they are building their businesses in the GTA, helping them to access advice and resources more quickly.
