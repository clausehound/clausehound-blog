[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/579550/disclosure+electronic+discovery+privilege/Attorneys+A+Common+Interest+Agreement+May+Not+Be+Worth+The+Paper+Its+Written+On) reveals the limited applicability of the common interest doctrine, which protects parties' express agreement to shield their communications (i.e., from disclosure to another party in a lawsuit). Communications designated as privileged and confidential under a common interest agreement can be deemed unprotected if there is no reasonable anticipation of litigation.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
