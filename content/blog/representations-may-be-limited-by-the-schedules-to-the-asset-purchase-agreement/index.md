*This article provides a good explanation on the definition of representations and warranties at the end of the first section, and their use in protecting an asset or share purchaser. The article also describes the due diligence process, and describes the types of clauses that can be included for the protection of the buyer.*

Specific exceptions to representations are generally contained in the schedules to the agreement.
