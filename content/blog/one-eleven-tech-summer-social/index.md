Our partner organization One Eleven is a fellow community organizer. We have attended the past two years of this event and are looking forward to attending this year at the end of July.

An open bar, food, music and all the right people. This event is known as the best tech social. Trust us, you don't want to miss it!

This is important for entreprenuers in the tech industry because you will be able to connect with people on many levels and who are performing many roles - from fellow entrepreneur, investor, advisor or customer, in the Toronto technology ecosystem.
