[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/202300/Consumer+Trading+Unfair+Trading/ACCC+Focus+on+Website+terms+and+conditions) advises Australian businesses with an online presence to review their website terms and conditions to ensure compliance with the Australian Consumer Law by removing or re-drafting any terms likely to confuse or mislead consumers into believing they cannot exercise their statutory rights to request repair, replacement or refund of faulty products or substandard services. The warning comes after a wave of internet sweeps conducted by the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC).
