Clausehound’s partner organization, Collage HR, shares their insights on Ontario’s new pharmacare plan for the Province’s youth. Starting on January 1, 2018, OHIP+ will provide universal healthcare to all youths under the age of 24. Medication and prescriptions will all be covered under the new plan as long as they have a prescription and Ontario health card. 

The initiative will cost the government $465 million a year, but they predict that the improved access and healthier families will offset this cost. What does this mean for entrepreneurs running their own business? Collage HR investigates the advantages of providing employees with benefit plans and the types of savings that will result from OHIP+.
