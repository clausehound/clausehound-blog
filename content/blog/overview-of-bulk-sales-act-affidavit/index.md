Overview of Bulk Sales Act Affidavit

 

What is this document?A Bulk Sales Affidavit is a document required by the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario). The purpose of the Bulk Sales Act is to protect creditors of a vendor against the sale of assets without the seller first satisfying outstanding debts to its creditors.

The list should include their names, addresses, nature of security, amount of indebtedness, and amount due on the date fixed for the completion of the sale. The Bulk Sales Act (Ontario) requires duplicate originals of the affidavit. The buyer should then ensure that the listed secured and unsecured creditors by the vendor/seller are paid. Within 5 days of the transaction closing, the buyer swears an affidavit attesting compliance with the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario). If the parties do not comply with the Bulk Sales Act (Ontario) the transaction could be deemed voidable and could allow the creditors of the vendor to apply to court to have the transaction set aside and could make the buyer liable to the seller’s creditors for outstanding debt.
