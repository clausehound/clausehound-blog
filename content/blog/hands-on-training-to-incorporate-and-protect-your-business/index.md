Our partner organizations **Workhaus** and **Cobalt Lawyers** want to bring awareness to an educational event for entrepreneurs that will be held at the end of July.

In this hands-on session, attendees will receive learning materials in advance and will be able to prepare and ask questions about company incorporation and liability issues to the lawyers who are presiding over the training session, prior to attending this small-room event.

This is important for entrepreneurs who are starting to build their business foundation. This is the start of a hands-on series that will ensure that entrepreneurs have thought through the important aspects of their business foundation.

To attend, here's the [Event Link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/incorporate-protect-your-startup-workhausu-side-hustle-session-tickets-35934446898). See you there!
