Our partner organization **CoMotion** is hosting a talk about Bitcoin and blockchains!

Hosted at CoMotion on King by Salvatore Delle Palme, a 5 year veteran in the cryptocurrency industry, this is an event welcome to all enthusiasts - expert and beginner alike!

If you're around on January 17, swing by and listen in on this talk about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have recently made an explosive comeback, reaching far greater peaks than their original rise to prominence in 2013.
