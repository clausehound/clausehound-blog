A library of legal contracts, clauses and articles, and annotated learning points

The Clausehound Small Business Law Library hosts over **150 legal contracts**, **thousands of clauses and articles**, and over **10,000 annotated learning points** that will help users learn the fundamentals of legal drafting. Agreement explanations, insights, and drafting notes are all embedded within our library and are displayed (as relevant)  at the clause level. Specifically **designed for entrepreneurs and young lawyers**, our product connects a deep and diverse knowledge library to relevant parts of each document, aggregated from legal news articles, case laws and interviews with established lawyers.

Recent updates to our product allows users to: 
- (a) Gain knowledge at the push of a button by review learning points and historical knowledge collected from previously drafted agreements (including knowledge from prior versions of the same draft); 
- (b) Zoom in or out for in-depth review of prior language or philosophy around drafting points; 
- (c) Download the document and edit the language directly

Users can access our legal library at no cost (does not include downloads of documents) and our monthly subscriptions allow for instant downloading of documents (pricing and number of downloads will vary). For a flat fee of $50, customers will have unlimited access to the Bussines Law Learning library and access to our Knowledge Helpdesk Team for one year.
