[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/515066/IT+internet/Browsewrap+Agreement+Held+Unenforceable+Website+Designers+Take+Note) examines a recent decision concerning **browsewrap agreements**. 

In the case, the Court ruled that browsewrap agreements are only enforceable where there is clear evidence that the user had knowledge of the terms of use. The defendant was unsuccessful in arguing that the plaintiff's occupation as a lawyer established that plaintiff had agreed to the terms of use.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
