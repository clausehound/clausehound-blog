[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/russianfederation/x/307026/Corporate+Governance/Company+Formation+In+Russia) details the various types of business entities in Russia and regulatory issues which may arise in a joint venture. Some joint venture proposals may require approval from Russian antimonopoly authorities. The business entities discussed include: (1) a Russian joint stock company (2) a Russian limited liability company and (3) a non-Russian company with a wholly-owned Russian operating subsidiary.
