[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/378100/Contract+Law/Knowledge+qualifiers+in+purchase+agreements+trends+and+considerations) provides an overview of how a seller can minimize liability by qualifying what constitutes knowledge of a misrepresentation, with absolute knowledge being most favourable to a seller and constructive knowledge as least favourable.
