[Sniffing out awesome startup events](http://blog.clausehound.com/tag/events/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=hackJustice&amp;utm_medium=referral), we’re venturing out of the doghouse to check out HACKJUSTICE’s two day ‘hackathon’ taking place on February 3rd and 4th. The hackathon will bring together legal professionals, students, computer scientists, members of the public, and professionals of various disciplines to code and create technology applications that will improve access to justice. Organized by the The Winkler Institute for Dispute Resolution at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto & the Cyberjustice Laboratory at the Université de Montréal, the event aims to develop technological solutions that will make justice more accessible for all.

Each team will have the opportunity to present their tech solution to panel of judges who will choose the hackathon winners based on the originality and usefulness tech developed.
