Be it resolved that I will go with the flow.

Be it resolved that I will not walk around all year with red, exhausted eyes. I will energize with ‎higher quality fuel (goodbye holiday treats..you were so good to me), take a full night's sleep, reserve mind space for non-work related stuff, restrict myself to half-pint work events (so easy to slip into the second beer), and I will have a sales & travel workout plan.

Be it resolved that I will work smarter. I will stop using my commuting time to draft documents, instead, I'll plan how to delegate and share the load with our talented team. I will ask for help.‎   I will visualize the daily lumps and bumps and will try to design the day in my mind, before arriving at work.

Be it resolved that I will let myself be open to the chaos.
 I will shut my laptop hours before bed. I'll put aside thoughts of investors and daily active users, and will just "hang". I have the privilege of meeting new people every day on the road in my job. I will make new friends and will hang out with old friends. I will go with the flow.
Be it resolved that 2017 will be the breakthrough year for my beloved Clausehound.

Here we go!
