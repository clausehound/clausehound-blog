More and more, the internet of things (IoT) is finding ways to connect devices so data can be shared to better build services for people. Clausehound is similarly dedicated to sharing its repository of legal knowledge and documents to entrepreneurs so they can more easily draft contracts to grow their ventures. 
** **
Businesses are using IoT to better monitor their devices and maintain their systems. However, doing so on your own is not simple, and can in fact be very costly and time-consuming. As a result, Clausehound’s partner organization, Open Sky Incubator, is hosting a workshop on how to use services like Microsoft Azure to quickly and securely connect your devices under IoT. The event will take place on Tuesday, May 30 at 41 Ardelt Place in Kitchener. 
** **
Be sure to attend to find out about how Microsoft Azure can host your IoT hub and to learn how to use the service. Tickets are only $5.
