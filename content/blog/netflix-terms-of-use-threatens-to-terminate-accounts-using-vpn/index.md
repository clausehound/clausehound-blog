This article is about Netflix Terms of Use Agreements. Netflix has decided to clamp down on those who use a VPN. A VPN is a virtual private network that many people use to avoid geographic restrictions for the content Netflix provides. Due to Netflix's licensing content restrictions certain movies/tv shows are only allowed to be viewed from certain geographic areas. Netflix has updated their terms of use to deter people from using VPNs. This is addressed in Article 6C and 6H which state “You may view a movie or TV show through the Netflix service primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such movie or TV show. The content that may be available to watch will vary by geographic location. Netflix will use technologies to verify your geographic location. We may terminate or restrict your use of our service, without compensation or notice if you are, or if we suspect that you are (i) in violation of any of these Terms of Use or (ii) engaged in illegal or improper use of the service”.

Termination of service is often the only immediate recourse a website owner has for a breach of the Terms of Use. Unfortunately, it also results in the long term loss of a customer.

- Website owners have a choice between including automatic or discretionary termination of accounts for breach of the website Terms of Use.
