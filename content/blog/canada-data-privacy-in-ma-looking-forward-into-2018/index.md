[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/662668/Data+Protection+Privacy/Data+Privacy+In+MA+Looking+Forward+Into+2018) discusses the implentation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the coming months. Special attention must be paid towards the impending changes to foreign mergers and acquisitions. Sara Josselyn at Norton Rose Fulbright Canada LLP suggests that parties planning on conducting foreign transaction should review their policies as the GDPR aims to strengthen European data privacy. As well as reviewing policy, parties should take this transitionary time to ensure their data security measures are up to standard.
