Clausehound’s partner organisation, Propel Entrepreneurship, has shared an interesting entrepreneurship story of one of their community members, Jenny Jay. The Double Jay Collective is the accumulation of Jenny’s works as an artist. It is an inspirational story demonstrating that new ventures come in many forms and are oftentimes truly representative of the business’ creator.
