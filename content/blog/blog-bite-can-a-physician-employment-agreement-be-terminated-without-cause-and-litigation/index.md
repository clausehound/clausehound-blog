[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/210532/employee+rights+labour+relations/Physician+Employment+Agreements+The+End+of+Termination+Without+Cause+Without+Litigation) states that **Physician Employment Agreements** that are terminated without cause are more likely to be upheld if the contract has *explicit language* that prevents lawsuits.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
