[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/280644/Charities+Non-Profits/Indemnification+Of+Trustees+Officers+And+Employees+What+Do+You+Have+What+Should+You+Have) illustrates why indemnification clauses should not be considered boilerplate, and why they should be reviewed frequently. The author explains that indemnification clauses are often drafted to protect trustees, directors, and in some cases employees. Whether boilerplate clauses are sufficient, or should be scrutinized by the parties who are either affording or receiving protection, is the subject matter of this article.
