**About our hands-on workshop series**:
 
There’s no better way to learn than by asking questions, thinking about what you’re signing, arguing and negotiating. This is a **hands-on** workshop, be prepared to interact with **questions and answers**, and to **negotiate deal points. Sample agreements** will be provided in advance, so that you can come in with questions ready.
 
In collaboration with Cobalt Lawyers - the official small business law training firm for the City of Toronto, **all episodes of this series (whether live or rebroadcast) will include a live Q&A throughout the presentation with our trainer lawyers, live chat and live case studies. Participants can also book 1:1 sessions with the trainer lawyers team during or prior to the session**.
 
This workshop was developed as part of a recurring Ask The Expert series in conjunction with the City of Toronto.
