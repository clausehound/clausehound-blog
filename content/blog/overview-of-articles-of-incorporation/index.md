**Overview of Articles of Incorporation**

 

**What is this document?**

Articles of Incorporation are the basic ‘constitution’ of a (business) corporation.

 

**When would I use this document?**

Articles of Incorporation are required when a corporation is incorporated.

 

**Who signs this document?**

Articles of Incorporation are filed with the corporate registrar in the relevant jurisdiction upon the incorporation of a corporation. Once they have been accepted they are ‘signed’ by the ‘Director’ of the jurisdiction in which the articles were filed.  The items contained within the articles of incorporation are a matter of public record, once filed.   

 

**More details about this document**

In Canada, a business corporation can be incorporated either federally or provincially. Articles of Incorporation can **range greatly in length and complexity**. They can be very simple (providing for only one share class) with few other clauses, or can be extremely detailed and contain clauses which might otherwise be found in by-laws or a shareholders’ agreement. Since amending the articles requires registration and payment of a fee, many incorporators keep the Articles of Incorporation as simple as possible, and leave other matters to the by-laws and shareholders’ agreement.

Articles of Incorporation must contain the **classes of shares** and the **rights and privileges** attached to those shares. For business corporations, each of the following rights: the right to vote, the right to dividends, and the right to participate on dissolution or wind-up of the corporation, must attach to at least one class of shares but all of these rights do not need to attach to the same class of shares. Some incorporating jurisdictions will reject an application to file the Articles of Incorporation if this requirement has not been met.

 

**What are the core elements of this document?**

The core elements of  Articles of Incorporation include: Corporate Name; Jurisdiction; Head Office; Share Classes;  Restrictions on Share Transfers; Restrictions on the Business; and Minimum and Maximum Number of Directors. Additional clauses may include: Redemption Rights; Power of Attorney; Restrictions on Securities Transfer, Conversion Rights.
