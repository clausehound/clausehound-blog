[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/257762/Trade+Secrets/NonDisclosure+Agreements+A+Cautionary+Tale) highlights the importance of correctly defining "confidential information," as well as following that definition as the organization does business moving forward. Specifically, the article highlights the dangers of requiring that information be marked 'confidential' in order to be protected, because if the practice is not followed, the disclosing party may be left without any remedy for misappropriation or disclosure of the information by the other party.
