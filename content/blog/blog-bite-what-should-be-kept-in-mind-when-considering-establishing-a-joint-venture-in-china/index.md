[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/china/x/181128/Corporate+Company+Law/Joint+Ventures+in+China+What+Every+CEO+Should+Know) notes the difficulty of establishing successful joint ventures in the Chinese market and suggests some best practices like being sensitive and open to a relationship that goes beyond business management to be respect-based and "face"-oriented, and to avoid the common practice of non-compliance with the law through maintaining comprehensive legal documentation on matters like ownership and management.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
