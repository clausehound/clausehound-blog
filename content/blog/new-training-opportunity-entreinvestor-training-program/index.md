In collaboration with our partner organization, the University-Industry Liason Office, we are proud to announce the Entreinvestor Training Program!

This program is for recent or soon-to-be graduates who already have a developed idea, in order to gain experience in being a successful entrepreneur.

At the end of the 8-week program in late April, there will be more than $1000 in prizes for the best investment portfolio.
