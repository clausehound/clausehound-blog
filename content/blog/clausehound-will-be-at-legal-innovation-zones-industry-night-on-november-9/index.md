Toronto, ON:

**This post is to inform our readers that Clausehound.com will be featured at the Legal Innovation Zone's Industry Night on November 9, 2016. **The event will take place at the Legal Innovation Zone (10 Dundas Street E, 10th Floor). Industry Night will operate from 6-9pm on that evening. Clausehound is excited to be pitching our business to the crowd that evening, so please come to learn more about legal technology and innovation!

Who we are: **Clausehound.com and our $10 per month small business law library is cloud-based software for entrepreneurs, small businesses and lawyers alike to help with the drafting of legal documents**.

Speak with us on November 9th to receive your promotional code!

[https://clausehound.com/](https://clausehound.com/)Clausehound.com will also be hosting a ‘fishbowl contest’ in which event attendees can drop a business card into our fishbowl for the chance at winning a one year subscription to Clausehound’s Small Business Law Library including access to our concierge (a pro feature).
