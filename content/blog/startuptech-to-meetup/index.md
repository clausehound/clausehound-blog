One can never attend too many networking events! This one will be taking place at Spaces Queen West.

It will be featuring **Fortay.ai**, a machine learning algorithm that smooths out your hiring process, along with a Q&A and oppurtunity to freely connect with others.

Be sure to grab your tickets for February 6 [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/startuptech-to-meetup-feb-2018-tickets-42592845347).
