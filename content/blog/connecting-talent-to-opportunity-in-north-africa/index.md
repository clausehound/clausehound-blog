Rajah Lehal, Founder and CEO of Clausehound has an organizational role in activating the BMW Foundation Responsible Leaders Networks in North America.

BMW Foundation is a supporter of TwentyThirty, an online magazine that highlights social innovation activities leading up to the UN sustainability targets for the year 2030.

Think.iT connects skilled, unemployed North African workers to international companies, but unlike any other traditional outsourcing agency; they work remotely, but are still very much a part of the team on-site!

Amazingly, these job oppurtunities also increase political stability in the region, by reducing unemployment which is the number one reason for people to join militia groups!
