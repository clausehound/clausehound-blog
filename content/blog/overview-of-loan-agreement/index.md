More details about this documentLoan Agreements can range in length depending on the complexity of the loan and how the payment will be paid. In some cases loans can be paid in a lump sum or can be paid in installments over a specified period of time. Lenders will include an interest clause in the document stipulating what interest rate is to be paid on the loan amount, and when interest payments are due. To reduce the risk that the borrower might not pay the amounts owed under the Loan Agreement, the parties may agree on collateral or security to be part of the deal. This can allow the lender to dispose of the borrower’s collateral (e.g jewellery, shares, vehicles, accounts receivable etc.) to obtain the money owed if the borrower defaults on the loan.
