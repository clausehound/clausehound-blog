When would I use this document?This policy can be used for companies that would like to have a policy in place to deal with drug and alcohol use/abuse in the workplace. This is something companies take seriously, and having a policy in place that all employees know about and have agreed to can be beneficial to the productivity of the company.

Companies may choose to have it apply only to employees, but may also extend it to independent contractors and volunteers while acting in the course of company business. Companies can define ‘company business’ to make it clear what situations will be covered by the policy. For example, the policy can apply even if personnel are not on the company’s property as long as they are engaged in ‘company business’.The policy will include a definition of reasonable grounds. This can include factors to be considered to determine whether someone is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The policy will outline the both the procedures to be taken when reasonable grounds exist for believing someone has breached the policy, and the consequences for breaching the policy.Because human rights and employment laws differ between jurisdictions, if an employer wishes to implement workplace testing for drugs or alcohol they should consult an employment lawyer in their jurisdiction to ensure compliance with local laws. 

 

What are the core elements of this document?The core elements of a Drug and Alcohol Policy are Definition of Company Business, Definition of Reasonable Grounds, Roles and Responsibilities, and Termination.
