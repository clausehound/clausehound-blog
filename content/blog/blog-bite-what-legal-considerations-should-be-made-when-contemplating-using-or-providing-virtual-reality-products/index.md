<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/412502/Trademark/Virtual+Reality+Creates+Potentially+Real+Legal+Issues) discusses recent legal developments that have taken place with the advancement of Virtual Reality (VR). The authors discuss the considerations that users, service providers, and platforms of VR should remember in relation to intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and copyrights. For instance, the authors note that, unlike trademark law, any reproduction of another’s property in a virtual experience, regardless of any commercial aspect to that reproduction, will likely constitute a copyright infringement in real life. These legal issues should be addressed in VR users’, service providers’, and platforms’ agreements. For contract negotiators who are concerned about acquisition, protection or potential infringement of company of intellectual property, this is an interesting read.
