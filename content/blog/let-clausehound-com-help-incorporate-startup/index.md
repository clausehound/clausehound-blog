Step 1. Things you should consider before beginning the incorporation process:1.1. [Naming your business](http://blog.clausehound.com/canadian-articles-of-incorporation-part-3-of-8-selecting-and-protecting-your-corporations-name-2/): Will you use a numbered company (i.e. 1234567 Ontario Inc.) or a named company (i.e. Clausehound Inc.)?1.2. [Jurisdiction](http://blog.clausehound.com/canadian-articles-of-incorporation-part-1-of-8-introduction-to-incorporation-2/): Will you be incorporating your business provincially or federally? 1.3. Corporate address: Have you chosen what your corporate address will be? Note, it cannot be a P.O. box. 1.4 [Business organization](http://blog.clausehound.com/canadian-articles-of-incorporation-part-4-of-8-what-to-consider-when-selecting-directors-for-my-business/): Have you thought about how many directors, officers, and shares the company will have? 1.5 Year end: Have you chosen a year end for accounting purposes?

 

Step 2. Create your Articles of Incorporation:On [Clausehound.com](https://clausehound.com/small-business-law-library/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=clausehoundHelpIncorporate&amp;utm_medium=referral), you will be able to find a number of Articles of Incorporation templates which can be inputted into the incorporation software. Choose the one that is fitting for your organization, fill it out using the decision making criteria outlined in Step 1, and have it ready to be copied into the incorporation software.

Step 3. It’s time to begin the incorporation. Remember that an Ontario corporation must file an Annual Return (which is not related to taxation, just registration of the business) within 60 days of incorporation. This may alternatively be completed directly through the Ontario government.
