When would I use this document?This document can be used when a corporation sells all or some of its assets. 

 

Who signs this document?This document is signed by the vendor/seller and the purchaser. If signing on behalf of a corporation this should be someone who has authority to bind the corporation. 

 

More details about this documentAn Asset Purchase Agreement can be used to buy/sell all or a portion of the assets of the corporation. The agreement will specify which assets. Often the purchaser will require satisfactory due diligence as a condition to the closing of the transaction.

This agreement differs from a Share Purchase Agreement, which can be used to acquire ownership of the corporation itself. The Asset Purchase Agreement does not transfer ownership of the corporation, but only in the assets specified.

This document will often contain many representations and warranties from both the vendor and the purchaser such as the right to title, right to assign, no encumbrances, corporate authorization and no litigation.If the transaction is subject to the laws of a jurisdiction with a Bulk Sales Act, parties should consider whether the Bulk Sales Act applies to the transaction. Courts have held that parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement cannot agree to “waive” the provisions of a Bulk Sales Act.
