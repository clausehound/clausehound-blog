[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/646882/Contract+of+Employment/The+Devil+Is+In+The+Details+The+Importance+Of+Sound+NonCompete+And+Confidentiality+Agreements) explains that weak confidentiality agreements may cause risk to companies that could be avoided, but it must be drafted properly to be enforceable by court. Most businesses have confidentiality agreements to prevent former employees from using information entrusted in them against the firm, but the problem is that sometimes they are not enforceable. It is important to pay attention to the details, for example: are the restrictions reasonable? Otherwise, it will be hard to enforce them through court.
