UPDATE:

September 9, 2016

We are excited to announce the winner of our** “**fishbowl” competition for one free year of Clausehound.com’s [Small Business Law Library](https://clausehound.com/small-business-law-library/)! Maayan Ziv, founder of [AccessNow](http://www.accessnow.me), a community platform that maps and promotes accessibility, is the winner of our one year subscription to our Small Business Law Library, which, with our concierge service, is valued at more than $600.

Maayan does great work in the community promoting accessibility. Her App, [AccessNow](http://www.accessnow.me), pin-points the accessibility status of locations, with the hope of turning red points (not sufficiently accessible) into green points (sufficiently accessible).  Relying on Maayan’s hard work, AccessNow hopes to improve accessibility worldwide through community input. We congratulate Maayan on winning Clausehound.com’s CNE competition, and we look forward to Maayan utilizing Clausehound.com’s Small Business Law Library to continue improving accessibility throughout the world!
