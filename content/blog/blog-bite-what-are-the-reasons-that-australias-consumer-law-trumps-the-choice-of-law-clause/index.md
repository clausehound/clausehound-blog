[Australia: Australian Consumer Law trumps Choice of Law clause](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/497678/Arbitration+Dispute+Resolution/Australian+Consumer+Law+trumps+Choice+of+Law+clause) discusses this recent Federal Court of Australia decision in which an American refund policy violated Australian consumer legislation. 

The court found that the statutory guarantees continued to the apply to the supply provisions under the contract and the statute makes a contract void to the extent it attempts to modify or exclude a remedy. Resultantly, the Australia consumer guarantees apply to goods that are supplied to Australian consumers and cannot contract out of those guarantees even through choosing a foreign law.
