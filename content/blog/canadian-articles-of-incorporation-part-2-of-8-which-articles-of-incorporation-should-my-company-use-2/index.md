**Canadian Articles of Incorporation – Part 2 of 4: ****Which Articles of Incorporation Should My Company Use?****Introduction- **
Upon considering whether one wants to incorporate their business federally or provincially, the next factor to consider is what the entrepreneur wants to achieve through their articles of incorporation. In order to determine this, it is crucial to consider who will be running the business, where will the business obtain its funding, whether there are any concerns that need to be mitigated, whether the individual is selling a product or performing services, etc.
