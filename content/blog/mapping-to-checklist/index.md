To map a checklist into an agreement:

- Read through the agreement clause by clause. After reading each clause, find the relevant section of the checklist.
- Using the comment function in Word, note which section of the checklist is associated with that clause of the agreement.
- Cross out the section on the checklist so that you are aware of which sections of the checklist have been implemented in the agreement.
