We've encountered this question quite a bit recently regarding *Why EDI instead of DEI*?

It is our belief that recognizing that an equity-based organization desires that all individuals, regardless of personal differences, will have an equal chance to
succeed, which will ultimately contribute to the overall success of an organization.  Equity is therefore the essence of a healthy diversity and inclusion program,
and for this reason we have ordered it first i.e. EDI instead of DEI.
