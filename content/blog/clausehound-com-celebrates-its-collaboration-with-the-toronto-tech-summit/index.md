Toronto, ON:

**On October 28, 2016, between 12:00-5:30 PM, Clausehound.com will be featured at the Toronto Tech Summit located at the St. Lawrence Centre for the Arts.** We’re celebrating new achievements and want to offer you some appealing incentives. The Toronto Tech Summit is a fantastic event where many innovative and experienced speakers will discuss the development of technological capabilities and how that can be leveraged to craft incredible experiences through technology. Members of the Clausehound.com team have attended two prior Toronto Tech Summit events, and we believe it is a great event.

Who we are: **Clausehound.com is a legal tool geared towards entrepreneurs, small businesses and lawyers alike to help draft legal documents to make businesses more productive.** The software hosts tens of thousands of legal clauses, contracts, articles, lawyer commentary and instructional videos. We even offer a concierge service (pro feature) should you have any questions while trying to source an agreement.

In conjunction with this announcement,** Clausehound is offering one free month of access to our Small Business Law Library **(which allows the unlocking and download of three legal documents) **to all attendees of the summit - come by our booth** and receive your free sponsorship gift!

[https://clausehound.com/](https://clausehound.com/)Clausehound.com will also be hosting a ‘fishbowl contest’ in which event attendees can drop a business card into our fishbowl for the chance at winning a one year subscription to Clausehound’s Small Business Law Library including access to our concierge (a pro feature).  Our concierge will source documents for you that do not presently exist in our library.   The value of this promotion is $600, a great prize for the lucky winner.  

Clausehound.com is proud to be working alongside such a great technology event, and we look forward to showcasing our new product to Toronto’s technology community.

**So come and check us out on October 28th between 12:00-5:30 PM.**

We hope to see you there!
