Sniffing outawesome startup events, we’re venturing out of the doghouse to check out the **IBK Capital & Ivey Business Plan Competition**, Canada's premier MBA business plan event and a competition that draws entrepreneurial teams from universities throughout North America and beyond. Taking place in London, Ontario and now in its 15th year, the competition offers graduate students the opportunity to present innovative new ventures to potential investors. Organized by the Pierre L. Morrissette Institute for Entrepreneurship and MBA student volunteers, the competition is funded by private sponsorship, with the winning team receiving $15,000. The competition also includes prizes for 2nd and 3rd placed teams and an award for the top Social Impact venture.

This year’s event promises to be the most exciting yet, with 9 teams from Canada, the U.S., and Thailand teams vying for that coveted $15,000 prize.  [Clausehound.com](https://www.clausehound.com/documents/)’s Founder & CEO Rajah Lehal is excited to be serving on the judging panel of this spirited competition for his 4th year running: “The caliber of competition and the level of excitement and energy around this event is fantastic.  As a graduate of Ivey’s MBA program and an entrepreneur myself, I love this event as an opportunity to reconnect with my classmates in the judging group.  This event is also an excellent way to keep tabs on the 'gaps' in local markets both inside and outside of Canada.”

The competition will be happening from January 20th - January 21st, 2017 at the Ivey Business School. Stay tuned to the Clausehound blog for Rajah’s report back on highlights!
