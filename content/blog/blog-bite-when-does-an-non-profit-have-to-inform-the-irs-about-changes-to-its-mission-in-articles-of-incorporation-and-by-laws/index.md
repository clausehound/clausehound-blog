[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/294976/Corporate+Commercial+Law/Informing+Regulators+When+You+Alter+Your+Mission) seeks to answer the question of when does the tax authority need to be notified when an non-profit changes their mission. The article is written by a US attorney and is concerned with information requirements to the US Internal Revenue Service.  However the topic is relevant to incorporations worldwide who should consider the issues presented, to determine whether any local reporting requirements have been triggered by updated articles of incorporation, by-laws or other constating documents, or by an updated business mandate in general.

This "blog bite" comes to you as a part of Clausehound's collaboration with Mondaq!
