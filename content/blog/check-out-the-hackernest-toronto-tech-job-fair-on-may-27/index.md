Getting down to business is something Clausehound is no stranger to. Wherever there’s a chance to talk or connect, we encourage involvement in the local scene and network until we can’t anymore! 
** **
As you can tell, we go to many events and fairs. They might seem to be all about work at first, but it’s just as much about meeting a bunch of great people. We’re always looking forward to the next one, and coming up soon is the big and friendly HackerNest Toronto Tech Job Fair on Saturday, May 27. It will take place at MaRS Discovery District in Toronto. If you register online tickets are only $10 or $15 at the door.Look forward to the mix of students as well as professionals from a variety of backgrounds and industries!
