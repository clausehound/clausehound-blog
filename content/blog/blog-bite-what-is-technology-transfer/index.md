[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/7871/Patent/The+Anatomy+of+a+Technology+Transfer+Agreement) discusses how, though details vary from transaction to transaction, agreements affecting technology transfers contain two essential elements: the sale or grant of a license under the proprietary rights (e.g., the patent rights and confidential information) of the owner of the technology; and a contractual obligation to transfer, (i.e., disclose) confidential information.
Before examining how the many clauses in a technology transfer agreement work, it is useful to clarify the distinctions between technology transfer and patent licensing.
The definitions identify the patent rights and confidential information being licensed (the "Licensed Rights"), the field in which the licensee may practice (the "Field") and the improvements to which the other party has license and/or technology transfer rights (the "Improvements").
This comes to you as a part of Clausehound’s exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
