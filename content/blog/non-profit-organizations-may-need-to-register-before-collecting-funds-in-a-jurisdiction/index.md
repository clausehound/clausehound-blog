Many jurisdictions require not for profit corporations to register before fundraising in the jurisdiction. One important element is the registered address of the corporation, and whether it has an office in the jurisdiction. A legitimate address is important for such registration.

In the first half of 2015, the Tennessee Department of State, Division of Charitable Solicitations and Gaming filed several lawsuits against non-profit organizations doing business in Tennessee. Each non-profit solicited contributions in Tennessee without registering with the Division, as required by Tennessee’s Charitable Solicitations Act. Under the Act, non-profits which solicit funds must register on forms provided by the Division. The article outlines the requirements for registration as well as the penalties for not registering. The registration requires disclosure of an extensive list of information, including tax status number, address, financial statements, names and addresses of directors and officers, corporate address etc.
