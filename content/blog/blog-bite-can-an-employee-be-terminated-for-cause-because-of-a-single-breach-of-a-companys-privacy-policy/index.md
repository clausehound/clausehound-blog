[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/248576/Trade+Secrets/Enforcement+Of+Privacy+Policy+In+Steel+v+Coast+Capital+Savings+Credit+Union) discusses a recent decision by the BC Supreme Court. The author explains that the decision indicates that Courts are prepared to treat policy breaches very seriously. In the case, the Court ruled that a company was justified in terminating an employee of 20 years with cause after a single breach of the company privacy policy.
