[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/157366/Contracts+Deeds/Entire+Agreement+Clauses) discusses the Supreme Court's decision in IHAG-Holding AG v. Intrawest Corporation, to look at a case where an entire agreement was not enforced. The article states that the Supreme Court determined it is justifiable to set aside an entire agreement clause when it is obvious that one party is relying on the clause to take advantage of a mistake.
