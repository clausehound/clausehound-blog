In Delaware, and in most other US jurisdictions, a written resolution of shareholders (in lieu of a shareholders’ meeting) can only pass if at least a majority of shareholders entitled to vote approve (>50%), although in some cases a corporation could, in its by-laws, raise that threshold to require a supermajority (e.g. ≥66.7%).

The “Action Without Meeting” clause in a corporation’s bylaws sets out the rules for providing notice to other shareholders before any corporate action is taken without a shareholders’ meeting. Notice of shareholder resolutions without a meeting can be vital, as otherwise a majority shareholder (or a particular voting block of shareholders constituting a majority) could impose a decision on the board of directors and other shareholders without even giving the other parties a chance to confer and participate in the decision-making process. This could lead to all sorts of drama, like a majority shareholder replacing the entire board of directors overnight!

Awareness is just the first step, but to really cover your bases, always consult with local counsel.
