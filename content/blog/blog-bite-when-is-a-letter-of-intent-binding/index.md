[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/292346/Securities/Letters+of+Intent+that+Bind) highlights how important it is for parties to clearly state their intentions when drafting a letter of intent (LOI).

Parties may intend for an LOI to be an enforceable agreement or non-binding, "agreement to agree".

The author explains that when considering if an LOI is binding the courts consider two (2) key factors. *First*, does the LOI contain all essential information relating to the transaction or does it refer to future negotiations about significant terms of the deal? *Second*, did the parties intend to be bound, understanding that the definitive agreement would mirror the terms outlined in the LOI, or intend to suspend all legal obligations until establishing a final agreement?

When preparing a non-binding LOI, parties should explicitly state the non-binding intent of the LOI (or of specific previsions). Further to this, parties should avoid using contractual language and refer to the document as an **LOI**, **term sheet**, or **agreement to agree**.
