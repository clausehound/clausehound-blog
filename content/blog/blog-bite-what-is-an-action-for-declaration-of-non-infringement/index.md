[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/597584/Patent/Golf+Ball+Technology+And+A+Declaration+Of+NonInfringement) reviews the case in which a golf ball manufacturer raised a complaint against Costco, who in turn brought an action for a declaration of non-infringement. The article discusses the strategic value of bringing forward such a pre-emptive claim. A conclusion to draw is that, in an M&A context, the acquirer could require (or budget for) such a declaration as a post-closing condition or undertaking.
